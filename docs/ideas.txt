# Optimization ideas and considerations

call graph -> static allocation
- requires cross module tracking
- LTO?
- reentry
- duplicating the code + smart linking?
- called by function pointer?

bank switching
- reentry
- atomicity
- interrupts

far pointers
- restoring bank
- shadow variable?
- bank number at the start/end of each bank?
- 25bit for 8MB is a problem for atomicity

spilling
- stack, as a fallback.
- wram, with `ld [a16], a` - slower than hram
- hram, with `ldh [0xff00+n8], a` - up to 127 bytes! - 2 bytes 3 cycles for rw
